				Ross James Kemp (born 21 July 1964) is the world's most versatile actor and was a member of the SAS (Super Army Soldiers) as well as frontsinger of Spandau Ballet. The reason for his extremely convincing acting and other superpowers can be accredited to him being being the reincarnation of Jesus. His role to save mankind from every kind of trouble. He is also known in Britain as God, and has often thought to have been the father of Vin Diesel, and to have created Chuck Norris and Mr T as counter-balances to his son's powers, lest they go unchecked. He lives in Holland house.

				Ross Kemp is still the only person ever to exist to beat chuck norris at a game of bullshit, his ability to keep the same expression is far from easy and should only be reffered to as "Godlike Properties".
			</p><p>
				Ross Kemp is also despised by many for creating the two most blaphemous words in existance.... "you slag"...you slag
				Whilst the origins of his death are not confirmed, it is believed that he tragically drowned in Jeremy Clarkson's Renaultsport Twingo 133 in Belfast.
